Music DSP collection
====================

The purpose of this "organization" to collect, in it's various repositories, audio and especially music related DSP algorythms, sources for plugins etc. Because there is a lot of that info that used to be available all over the internet, but things get deleted, sites go offline, people shift focus of what interests them etc.

Some rules need to be set from the get go:

1. We only include things which are open-source licensed, and then only when license is known or can be safely implied. 
    
    For example: If a known (don't mean well-known) developer pusblished source for other people to use and has said or implied that they are free to ose the code as they see fit -- it's free to call it 'public domain'. If it's shady but REALLY usefull, include it in the 'Unclean' repository, so that people can protest it. 

2. We only fork stuff that's likely to go the abandonware route (didn't get updated for ages, the person(s) involved seem to be occupied with something else etc.)

3. We won't limit ourselves to rescuing abandonware, off course. Original submissions are more than wellcome.
